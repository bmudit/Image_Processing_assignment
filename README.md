# Image_Processing_assignment
#### This repository contains my first image processing assignment which I got while applying for an internship at Dimentionless Technologies. 
#### I had to overlay the threat images over the backgrounds in such a way that it looks like the threat object were already there.
#### The background images are basically X-ray images of baggages at an airport facility to detect if any illegal/threat object is being carried by any passenger.
#### I used the PIL library of python for this assignment. It's really easy to learn and use for basic opperations!

* *Bg* folder contains the background images.
* *threat* folder contains the threat obejct images.
* *submission* folder contains my final output.
* *code.py* contains my code.
* *code_guide.txt* contains the summary of the code I used.
